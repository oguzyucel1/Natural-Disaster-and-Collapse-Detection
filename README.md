## Overview
This repository contains three computer-vision models for real-time detection and classification tasks:

1. **Natural Disaster Detection Model** ‚Äì identifies events like volcanoes, avalanches, floods, wildfires, earthquakes, landslides, tsunamis, etc., by combining YOLOv11 with MobileNetV2 and ResNet50 heads.    
2. **Building Collapse Detection Model** ‚Äì finds and classifies collapsed vs. intact structures by using YOLOv11.
3. **Fire Detection Model** ‚Äì specifically detects active fires in images/video streams using YOLOv11.

## Models

### Natural Disaster Detection Model
- **Architecture**: YOLOv11  
- **Input**: Single images or video frames  
- **Output**: Bounding boxes + class labels for each disaster type  
- **Classes**:  
  - Volcano  
  - Avalanche  
  - Flood  
  - Wildfire  
  - Earthquake fault rupture  
  - Landslide  
  - Tsunami  
  - ‚Ä¶and more  
- **Dataset**:  
  - Aggregated from public sources (NASA, USGS, NOAA) and web-scraped images, generated images by using stable diffusion and annotated in COCO format.
 - **Workflow**:  
  1. YOLOv11 proposes bounding boxes around building regions.  
  2. Cropped regions are passed to MobileNetV2 or ResNet50 classifiers to confirm ‚ÄúCollapsed‚Äù vs. ‚ÄúIntact.‚Äù
- **Key Features**:  
  - Real-time inference (~45 FPS on a GTX 1080 Ti)  
  - Non-maximum suppression to reduce duplicates  
  - Adjustable confidence threshold via CLI/API  

### Building Collapse Detection Model
- **Detection Backbone**: YOLOv11 for coarse localization     
- **Dataset**:  
  - https://universe.roboflow.com/metehan-kandemir/collapse-detector
  - This dataset was collected and prepared by Metehan Kandemir as part of a civil engineering graduation project. Its purpose is to assess the collapse status of buildings, categorized as Partial Collapse,    Global Collapse, or Non-Collapse.
- **Transfer Learning**:  
  - Base networks pretrained on ImageNet, fine-tuned on collapse dataset (224√ó224 inputs, batch size 32).

### Fire Detection Model
- **Architecture**: YOLOv11  
- **Input**: Images or video streams  
- **Output**: Bounding boxes around active fire regions  
- **Classes**:  
  - Fire  
- **Dataset**:  
  - https://universe.roboflow.com/anaworkspace/fire_smoke_detection-bqivj/dataset/1
- **Key Features**:  
  - Real-time inference (~45 FPS on a GTX 1080 Ti)  
  - Tunable confidence threshold  
  - Robust to smoke and varied lighting
